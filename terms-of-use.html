<p style="text-align: justify;">3.5.1.

Each Product’s ledger is the definitive record of transactions and balances.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3.5.2. If you believe that your statement of Account contains any errors, please notify us immediately of such error, along with any additional information concerning the error.

Transmission, Storage and Security of Your Personal Information
<br /><br />
Security over the internet
<p style="text-align: justify;">5.1. No data transmission over the Internet or website can be guaranteed to be secure from intrusion. However, we maintain commercially reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information in accordance with data protection legislative requirements.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">5.2. All information you provide to us is stored on our or our subcontractors’ secure servers and accessed and used subject to our security policies and standards. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password that enables you to access certain parts of our websites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential and for complying with any other security procedures that we notify you of. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.</p>
Export outside the EEA (this section only applies if you are based in the EEA)
<p style="text-align: justify;">5.3. Your personal information may be accessed by staff or suppliers in, transferred to, and/or stored at, a destination outside the EEA in which data protection laws may be of a lower standard than in the EEA. Regardless of location or whether the person is an employee or contractor, we will impose the same data protection safeguards that we deploy inside the EEA.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">5.4. Certain countries outside the EEA have been approved by the European Commission as providing essentially equivalent protections to EEA data protection laws and therefore no additional safeguards are required to export personal information to these jurisdictions. In countries that have not had these approvals, (see the full list here http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/adequacy/index_en.htm), we will either ask for your consent to the transfer or transfer it subject to European Commission approved contractual terms that impose equivalent data protection obligations directly on the recipient unless we are permitted under applicable data protection law to make such transfers without such formalities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">5.5. Please contact us as set out in section 6.4 below if you would like to see a copy of the specific safeguards applied to the export of your personal information.</p>
Storage Limits
<p style="text-align: justify;">5.6. We will retain your personal information for as long as is necessary for the processing purpose(s) for which they were collected and any other permitted linked purpose (for example certain transaction details and correspondence may be retained until the time limit for claims in respect of the transaction has expired or in order to comply with regulatory requirements regarding the retention of such data). So if information is used for two purposes, we will retain it until the purpose with the latest period expires; but we will stop using it for the purpose with a shorter period once that period expires.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">5.7. We restrict access to your personal information to those persons who need to use it for the relevant purpose(s). Our retention periods are based on business needs, and your information that is no longer needed is either irreversibly anonymised (and the anonymised information may be retained) or securely destroyed. By way of example:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">use to perform a contract: in relation to your personal information used to perform any contractual obligation to you, we may retain that personal information whilst the contract remains in force plus a further period (depending on jurisdiction and other factors) to deal with any queries or claims thereafter; copies of evidence obtained in relation to AML checks: in relation to your personal information obtained in relation to AML checks, we may retain that personal information whilst our client relationship remains in force plus a further 5 years to deal with any queries or claims thereafter; and where claims are contemplated: in relation to any information where we reasonably believe it will be necessary to defend or prosecute or make a claim against you, us or a third party, we may retain that information for as long as that claim could be pursued.</p>
Anonymity
<p style="text-align: justify;">5.8. GNG and other virtual currencies may not be fully anonymous as a result of the public digital ledgers reflecting these currencies. Generally, anyone can view the balance and transaction history of any public wallet address. We, and others who are able to can match your public wallet address to other information about you, and also may be able to identify you from a blockchain transaction. Furthermore, third parties may use data analytics to identify other information about you. Please note that such third parties have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for their policies or processing of your personal information.</p>
Marketing
<p style="text-align: justify;">6.1. You have the right to ask us not to process your personal information for marketing purposes. We will inform you if we intend to use your information for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by not checking certain boxes on our marketing consent form. You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us as set out below.</p>
Updating Information
<p style="text-align: justify;">6.2. We will use reasonable endeavours to ensure that your personal information is accurate. In order to assist us with this, you should notify us of any changes to the personal information that you have provided to us by contacting us as set out below.</p>

Processing for Fraud Prevention and Detection Purposes
<p style="text-align: justify;">7.1 Before we provide our services to you, we undertake checks for the purposes of preventing fraud and money laundering and to verify your identity. These checks require us to process personal information about you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">7.2. The personal information you have provided, we have collected from you, or we have received from third parties will be used to prevent fraud and money laundering and to verify your identity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">7.3 In order to do so, we may provide information to, obtain information from, and verify information with fraud prevention and debt collection agencies and credit reference agencies (in their role as fraud prevention agents). We will continue to exchange information with such parties while you have a relationship with us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">7.4. We, fraud prevention and debt collection agencies and credit reference agencies may also enable law enforcement agencies to access and use your personal information to detect, investigate and prevent crime.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">7.5. Fraud prevention agencies and credit reference agencies can hold your personal information for different periods of time, and if you are considered to pose a fraud or money laundering risk, your data can be held for up to six years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">7.6. As part of the processing of your personal information, decisions may be made by automated means. This means we may automatically decide that you pose a fraud or money laundering risk if our processing reveals your behaviour to be consistent with money laundering or known fraudulent conduct, or is inconsistent with your previous submissions, or you appear to have deliberately hidden your true identity. You have rights in relation to automated decision making as set out in section 4 of this policy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">7.7. As a consequence of processing, if we, or a fraud prevention agency or credit reference agency, determine that you pose a fraud or money laundering risk, we may refuse to provide the services you have requested or we may stop providing existing services to you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">7.8. A record of any fraud or money laundering risk will be retained by the fraud prevention agencies and credit reference agencies, and may result in others refusing to provide services, financing or employment to you. If you have any questions about this, please contact us as per section 6 of this policy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">7.9. If you are based in the EEA, whenever fraud prevention agencies transfer your personal data outside of the EEA, they impose contractual obligations on the recipients of that data to protect your personal data to the standard required in the EEA.

<div class="justify-content-between"><h1 class="display-5">Law Inforcement Requests</h1>
Last updated: January 10, 2020
<p style="text-align: justify;">From time to time, GNG receives information requests about its customers from law enforcement agencies around the world. This page is here to provide you and law enforcement with information about how these requests are processed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When GNG is contacted, law enforcement is generally interested in two types of data: information about customers’ identities and information about their activities using GNG Tokens.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When information requests are received, GNG requires that it be accompanied by appropriate legal process. This can vary from place to place. For example, production orders, search warrants, and subpoenas, but also requests for voluntary disclosure of data may all amount to legal process. GNG reviews each order and request for voluntary disclosure to determine that it has valid legal basis and that any response is narrowly tailored to ensure that only the data to which law enforcement is entitled is provided.</p>
GNG also reserves the right to make disclosures to authorities in order to protect itself, any Associates, and its customers.
<br /><br />
GNG welcomes inquiries from law enforcement agencies about its policies and procedures. Please contact GNG at gngcoin@msgsafe.io

<div class="justify-content-between"><h1 class="display-5">Risk Disclosure Statement</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Trading in Digital Tokens entails certain risks. This risk disclosure statement cannot and does not disclose all risks and other aspects involved in holding, trading, or engaging in Digital Tokens. Risks include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Market Risk: The market for Digital Tokens is still new and uncertain. No-one should have funds invested in Digital Tokens or speculate in Digital Tokens that she is not prepared to lose entirely. Whether the market for one or more Digital Tokens will move up or down, or whether a particular Digital Token will lose all or substantially all of its value, is unknown. This applies both to traders that are going long and to traders that are shorting the market. Participants should be cautious about holding Digital Tokens.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Liquidity and Listing Risk: Markets for Digital Tokens have varying degrees of liquidity. Some are quite liquid while others may be thinner. Thin markets can amplify volatility. There is never a guarantee that there will be an active market for one to sell, buy, or trade Digital Tokens or products derived from or ancillary to them. Furthermore, any market for tokens may abruptly appear and vanish. GNG makes no representations or warranties about whether a Digital Token that may be used on the Site may be used on the Site at any point in the future, if at all. Any Digital Token is subject to delisting without notice or consent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Legal Risk: The legal status of certain Digital Tokens may be uncertain. This can mean that the legality of holding or trading them is not always clear. Whether and how one or more Digital Tokens constitute property, or assets, or rights of any kind may also seem unclear. Participants are responsible for knowing and understanding how Digital Tokens will be addressed, regulated, and taxed under applicable law.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Exchange Risk (Counterparty Risk): Having Digital Tokens on depositor with any third party in a custodial relationship has attendant risks.These risks include security breaches, risk of contractual breach, and risk of loss. Participants should be wary of allowing third parties to hold their property for any reason. Digital Token transactions are not reversible. Once you send Digital Tokens to an address, whether intentionally or by a fraudulent or accidental transaction, you accept the risk that you may lose access to, and any claim on, those Digital Tokens indefinitely or permanently.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Trading Risk: In addition to liquidity risks, values in any digital token marketplace are volatile and can shift quickly. Participants in any Digital Tokens market are warned that they should pay close attention to their position and holdings, and how they may be impacted by sudden and adverse shifts in trading and other market activities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Banking Risk: Any stablecoin project (like GNG) relies on financial institutions and counterparties to hold funds, cash equivalents, and other assets to back the tokens that are issued, outstanding, and freely circulating. These parties have their own policies and may change their view and acceptance of any stablecoin at any time. This may result in delays and other barriers to redemption and sale. Digital Token holders should be aware of these risks at all times. Additionally, Reserves held at or through financial institutions or intermediaries may be subject to the risk of loss, theft, insolvency, and governmental and regulatory freezes and seizures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Counterparty Risk: Assets backing digital assets such as GNG Tokens, including loan receivables owed to GNG, are subject to the risk of default, insolvency, inability to collect, and illiquidity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Valuation Risk: GNGs are backed 100% by GNG’s Reserves. Those Reserves are not insured and could be subject to unexpected diminution in value or to governmental and regulatory freezes and seizure. This may result in delays and other barriers to redemption and sale. GNG Tokens are not a fiat currency and are not issued, backed, or guaranteed by any government. As with all investments, there is a risk of loss in owning GNG Tokens. Token holders should be aware of these risks at all times.</p>
